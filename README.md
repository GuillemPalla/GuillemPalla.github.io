# Hypermedia Project - Curriculum Vitae
PROJECT ANALYSIS:  

->Target User Profile:  

The profile of the target user of this website is someone who is seeking to know more about my capabilities as a potential employee, maybe someone who is considering employing me for a certain job. The viewer will want to easily learn my abilities as a worker, as well as important information like my residency or the languages I speak. Because of this, is preferable that the website is short to read, without unnecessary information, and its sections easy to find.

->Information Architecture:  

In this case, the architecture of the page isn't relevant. The website will only consist of one single page with the Curriculum Vitae.  

->Visual Design:  

We want a simple, easy to read and comfortable document. We don't want to write too much information, since the reader will very much prefer a short and precise summary of my profile as a worker. Firstly, the color palette we will use will be mainly black and white, with the objective to give a formal and elegant look to the CV. We will use an standard formal typography, like Arial or similar. The project can be divided into two columns, left and right, each column showcasing different information. It's important that the main title of the CV, located top left of the page, contains my name followed by my profession. Then, the curriculum will also have to feature details like my contact information, the languages I speak, the education I have and, since I am a computer engineer, the programming languages I know. The document can also include a brief explanation of my abilities, aspirations and objectives, because this may be of interest to the reader.
